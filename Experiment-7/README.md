## **Title**

To study different types of loops in Python.

## **Aim**

To understand and implement looping constructs in Python such as for loop, while loop, nested loops, and loop control statements for solving programming problems efficiently.

---

## **Objectives**

* To understand the concept of iteration.
* To learn syntax and working of for and while loops.
* To implement nested loops.
* To understand break and continue statements.
* To apply loops in real programming scenarios.

## **Theory**

Loops are control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a given condition. They help reduce repetition, improve program efficiency, and make code more structured and readable. Instead of writing the same instructions multiple times, loops allow automation of repetitive tasks.

Iteration is the process of repeating a set of instructions. Each repetition is called an iteration. Loops control how many times a set of statements is executed and determine when the execution should stop.

Python provides flexible looping structures that support logical operations, mathematical calculations, data processing, and pattern generation.

### **1. While Loop**

A while loop executes statements repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. It is mainly used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a logical condition. The condition is checked before executing the loop body, making it an entry-controlled loop.

Syntax:

```
while condition:
    statements
```

Characteristics:

* Condition-based iteration.
* Suitable for dynamic situations.
* Requires proper updating of variables to avoid infinite loops.

---

### **2. For Loop**

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as numbers, lists, strings, or ranges. It is generally used when the number of iterations is known or when traversing through elements of a collection.

Syntax:

```
for variable in sequence:
    statements
```

Characteristics:

* Simplifies iteration over sequences.
* Automatically handles loop variable updates.
* Widely used for counting and traversal tasks.

---

### **3. Nested Loops**

Nested loops refer to placing one loop inside another loop. The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop. Nested loops are commonly used in:

* Pattern printing
* Matrix operations
* Multi-dimensional data processing
* Combination and permutation problems

---

### **4. Loop Control Statements**

Loop control statements alter the normal flow of execution.

* **Break:** Immediately terminates the loop when a specific condition is met.
* **Continue:** Skips the remaining statements in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
* **Pass (conceptual):** Acts as a placeholder where a statement is required syntactically but no action is performed.

---

### **5. Advantages of Using Loops**

* Reduces code redundancy.
* Improves efficiency and readability.
* Allows automation of repetitive operations.
* Enhances logical problem-solving ability.

---

## **Programs Covered**

* Number printing using loops
* Factorial calculation
* Fibonacci series
* Armstrong number
* Prime number checking
* Pattern printing
* Matrix operations
* Digit combinations
* Use of break and continue

## **Conclusion**

In this experiment, looping concepts in Python were studied and implemented. Different types of loops such as for loops, while loops, and nested loops were used to solve various programming problems. Loop control statements enhanced understanding of program flow and logic building.
